## Core Workflow

1. Inspect the repo before writing:
   - `README.md`, `package.json` / project metadata, screenshots, examples, docs, license, deploy scripts, test scripts.
   - GitHub and community surfaces: About description, homepage, topics, social preview, license, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue templates, PR template, releases/changelog when present.
   - GitHub remote state via `gh repo view --json name,description,homepageUrl,repositoryTopics,url,defaultBranchRef,isPrivate,licenseInfo`.
2. Decide the public positioning:
   - One-line hook in Chinese and English, with the Chinese version first.
   - Target users and why they should try it now.
   - Clear boundary between product value, technical architecture, and private/local setup.
   - Intended release posture: showcase-only, user-installable tool, external-contributor project, library/package, or deployed product.
3. Rewrite or patch README as a product page:
   - `README.md` is the GitHub front door. For Qiaomu-owned repos, it must be Chinese-first and bilingual by default.
   - Put Chinese first, then English. Do this unless the user explicitly asks for English-only or the repo has a documented non-Qiaomu upstream requirement.
   - A separate `README.zh-CN.md` is allowed, but it does not satisfy this requirement by itself; the default `README.md` must show Chinese first.
   - English can be a full lower section anchored by `# English`, a linked `README.en.md`, or a compact mirrored section, but install/try, verification, limits, and license/access expectations must be understandable to English readers.
   - Put hook, CTAs, badges, screenshot, feature list, quick start, examples, verification, limitations, and troubleshooting near the top.
   - Use real screenshots or output samples when available; do not invent screenshots.
4. Set GitHub About:
   - Use a compact bilingual description by default for Qiaomu-owned public repos, Chinese first and English second.
   - Add homepage URL when there is a live demo.
   - Add focused topics; avoid topic spam.
   - For public launch polish, create or request a social preview image. If it cannot be automated, record the manual GitHub Settings step as a follow-up instead of pretending it was set.
5. Improve trust surfaces according to release posture:
   - Always verify license state for open source repos.
   - For external-contributor projects, add or update `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue templates, and a PR template when missing or stale.
   - For showcase-only repos, explain if contribution/community files are intentionally omitted.
6. Verify what the README promises:
   - Run project-provided lint/build/test commands when relevant.
   - For skills, verify `npx skills add` discoverability/installability.
   - For websites, verify live URL/API/health after deployment when applicable.
7. Publish through a clean GitHub flow:
   - Use a feature branch and PR.
   - Never push directly to `main`.
   - If verification passes and the user has not explicitly asked to hold, merge the PR into `main`.
   - In the final response, include the PR URL and merge commit.

## Source-Backed Presentation Model

This skill is grounded in GitHub's own repository presentation surfaces:

- README: GitHub says a repository README should explain what the project does, why it is useful, how users get started, where to get help, and who maintains it. GitHub automatically surfaces a recognized README to visitors.
- Topics: GitHub topics help people discover repositories by purpose, subject area, community, language, or other important qualities.
- License: GitHub's license guidance says a public repository needs an open source license before others are clearly free to use, change, and distribute it.
- Community profile: GitHub's public repository checklist looks for README, license, code of conduct, contributing guide, security policy, and issue/PR templates.
- Security policy: `SECURITY.md` tells people how to report vulnerabilities.
- Issue and PR templates: templates standardize the information contributors provide when opening issues or pull requests.
- Social preview: GitHub lets repository maintainers set a social preview image from repository settings; use solid backgrounds when transparency may render unpredictably.

Use official docs first when this guidance conflicts with a blog checklist.

## README Standard

### Language Gate

For Qiaomu-owned public repositories, `README.md` must be Chinese-first bilingual before release:

- First viewport: project name, Chinese value proposition, English value proposition, badges/links, and a visible language switch such as `**中文** | [English](#english)`.
- Main body: Chinese sections first, written as the default reader experience.
- English access: provide a substantive English section or linked English README. At minimum, English readers must understand what it does, how to try/install it, what is verified, and the main limits/prerequisites.
- Translation files such as `README.zh-CN.md` and `README.en.md` may exist, but the GitHub default `README.md` still has to open with Chinese first unless the user explicitly approved a different audience.
- If `README.md` is English-only, English-first, or relies on a separate Chinese file for the Chinese experience, stop and fix it before opening/merging the release PR.

### First-Viewport Gate

The top of `README.md` should pass a 60-second stranger test:

- What is this, in one concrete sentence?
- Who is it for and what pain does it remove?
- What can I click, install, or try immediately?
- What proof can I see: screenshot, demo, sample output, CI badge, or verified command?
- What should I trust: license, maintainer, security/privacy boundary, and last verified status?

Avoid badge walls, abstract taglines, and architecture-first openings. Architecture belongs after the user understands the product value.

Public README must answer five questions fast:

- What pain does this solve?
- What do I get after installing/running it?
- Can I see proof in a screenshot, demo, or example output?
- How do I try it in less than five minutes?
- What are the limits, costs, or prerequisites?

Recommended structure:

```markdown
# Project Name

> 中文价值主张
> English value proposition

[Live Demo] [Install] [Docs] [License] [CI]

![Screenshot](docs/assets/product-screenshot.png)

**中文** | [English](#english)

### Proof And Media

- Prefer one real screenshot, demo GIF, terminal transcript, API response, generated artifact, or hosted demo near the top.
- Every screenshot or sample must match a current verified state. Do not use mock images unless clearly labelled as design mockups.
- For CLI/tools, include a short successful command transcript and a failure/troubleshooting example.
- For websites/apps, include live URL, deployment target, health/API check, and a desktop/mobile screenshot when feasible.
- Keep README comfortably below GitHub's 500 KiB render-truncation limit; if docs grow large, split deeper material into `docs/` and link it.

## GitHub Surface Standard

### GitHub About Standard

Use a compact bilingual form by default for Qiaomu-owned public repos:

```text
中文短描述 | English short description.
```

Keep it concrete. Good examples:

- `把 App Store 评价变成产品研究证据，发现痛点、机会和版本风险 | Turn App Store reviews into product research evidence: pain points, opportunities, and version risks.`
- `把任意资料整理成 NotebookLM 可用知识包 | Turn messy sources into NotebookLM-ready knowledge packs.`

Topics should be narrow and useful:

- domain: `app-store`, `app-reviews`, `notebooklm`, `geo`
- stack: `nextjs`, `agent-skill`, `deepseek`
- audience/workflow: `product-management`, `ai-workflow`

Avoid generic topics like `tool`, `website`, `ai` unless they add discoverability.

### Homepage, Badges, And Social Preview

- Set homepage to the live demo, documentation, install page, or product home. If none exists, leave it blank rather than pointing to an unrelated page.
- Use a small badge row: CI/build, license, package/install, live demo, version, or coverage only when those links are real and maintained.
- Add or request a social preview image for public launches, especially when the repo will be shared on X, WeChat, newsletters, or product directories.
- If social preview cannot be set via CLI/API in the current environment, leave an explicit manual checklist item: GitHub repo Settings -> Social preview -> Upload image.
- Social preview art should show the project name, one concrete promise, and the relevant UI/output. Use a solid background unless transparency has been checked.

## Qiaomu Profile Block

For Qiaomu-owned public repos, include profile/support links by default:

- `qiaomu.ai`
- `blog.qiaomu.ai`
- `tuijian.qiaomu.ai`
- X `@vista8`
- GitHub `@joeseesun`
- WeChat public account `向阳乔木推荐看`

Use `qiaomu-profile` as the source of truth for bios and assets. Do not invent personal claims.

## Community Health Standard

Apply this based on project posture, not mechanically:

- Open-source repos must have a license or an explicit "not yet licensed" blocker.
- External-contributor projects should include `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue templates, and a PR template.
- User-installable tools should at least document support/help, security/privacy boundaries, and how to report bugs.
- Small showcase repos may omit contribution files, but README should say whether contributions are welcome, not expected, or not supported.
- For issue templates, prefer structured forms for bugs/features when the project expects outside reports.
- PR templates should ask for summary, verification, screenshots/output when relevant, and linked issues.

## Release Checklist

Before claiming done:

- `README.md` is Chinese-first bilingual by default; a separate `README.zh-CN.md` alone is not enough.
- README first viewport passes the stranger test: value, audience, action, proof, trust.
- README has no TODO/placeholders.
- Screenshots, demos, samples, and links exist or are explicitly marked not applicable.
- `LICENSE` exists or the repo intentionally omits one.
- Community health files are present or intentionally omitted based on release posture.
- `gh repo view` confirms About/homepage/topics.
- Social preview was set, or a manual follow-up was recorded.
- Relevant build/test/install checks passed.
- Git diff was scanned for secrets.
- PR was merged into `main` unless explicitly held.

## Guardrails

- Do not publish secrets, `.env.local`, private paths, cache data, tokens, or runtime databases.
- Do not overpromise current features; mark roadmap items clearly.
- Do not bury setup failures in the README; make prerequisites explicit.
- Do not treat Chinese-first bilingual README work as optional polish for Qiaomu-owned GitHub releases.
- Do not create performative community files for a repo that is not ready for contributors; explain the posture instead.
- Do not claim a social preview, screenshot, demo, package install, or live URL exists unless verified in the current run.
- Do not leave a verified PR dangling when the user expects publication.
